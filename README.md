# Machine Learning Lab – Assignment 1 (MATLAB Grader)

This repository contains my solutions for **Assignment 1** of the course  
**521289S – Machine Learning (Spring 2026)**, completed using **MATLAB** and evaluated via **MathWorks MATLAB Grader**.

The assignment focuses on building core MATLAB skills that are essential for machine learning workflows, including data handling, vectorization, function design, function handles, and basic visualization.
